<h2>Conquer Asahi Mountain</h2>
<p>Mount Asahi (旭岳 Asahi-dake?) is a mountain located in the town of Higashikawa, Hokkaido and is the highest mountain on the island of Hokkaido. It is part of the Daisetsuzan volcanic group in the Ishikari Mountains, located north of Daisetsuzan National Park. <br>

The mountain is popular with hikers in the summer and is easily accessible from Asahidake Onsen via the Asahidake Ropeway. In winter, the mountain is open to skiing lovers. <br>

Sugatami Lake, just below the summit, is famous for its reflections of mountain peaks, snow, and steam escaping from volcanic vents.</p>
<h3 class="mountaintitle">Geological</h3>
<p>Mount Asahi is an active stratovolcano, 2,291 meters (7,516 ft) high,[2] arising 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) southwest of the Ohachi-Daira caldera. The Japan Meteorological Agency ranked C volcanic activity. The volcano consists mainly of andesite and dacite, This Holocene volcano has mafic non-alkaline rocks less than 18,000 years old. In addition to the main peak, there is a smaller volcano rising from the southeastern shoulder of the mountain, Mount Ushiro Asahi or Mount Asahi in Back (後旭岳 Ushiro-Asahi-dake?).</p>

<p><b>Eruption history</b></p>
<p>There are no historical records of the eruption of Mount Asahi. Tephrochronology and radiocarbon geochemical techniques have identified the following events:</p>
<div class="ul-li-mountain">
    <ul class="pac-details ">
        <li><p>3200 BC ± 75 years, Asahi Soria deposit, radiocarbon dating, explosive eruption</p></li>
        <li><p>2800 BC ± 100 years, As-A tephra, corrected radiocarbon dating, explosive eruption and phreatic explosion</p></li>
        <li><p>1450 BC ± 50 years, Tephra As-B, unresolved radiometric date, explosive eruption and phreatic explosion</p></li>
        <li><p>500 BC ± 50 years, Ash-b tephra, tephrochonology, explosive eruptions and phreatic explosions and debris avalanches</p></li>
        <li><p>1739, Tephrochronology, explosive eruption and phreatic explosion with possible eruption of central vent and internal material</p></li>
    </ul>
